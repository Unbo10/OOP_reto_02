# * Inheritance is a way to lend or borrow code from a class to another, so you don't have to write the same code again and again. It in consequence allows you to create a family of classes in which the children (derived classes) inherit attributes and methods from the parent(s) (base) class(es) that are in turn now part of them. Therefore, if you create an object of a derived class it will have all the attributes and methods of the parent class as well as of its own class.

# * super(Type, object_or_type = none) is a proxy object, i.e., a copy of the self() object of the base or parent class that lends or delegates method calls and attribute access to the object of Type (the instance of a child or derived class).
